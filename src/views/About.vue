    <p>
      <strong>Proot Records</strong> is a Netlabel founded by
      <a href="https://thiazitch.com/">Thiaz Itch</a> in 2006.
    </p>

    <p>
      Its purpose is to gather artists making
      <strong>happy and original music</strong>, by sharing
      <strong>free albums</strong> to listen and/or download, and producing
      physical releases.
    </p>

    <p>
      By extension, Proot works also with graphical artists for the artworks of
      its albums and some short films like movie clips and teasers.
    </p>

    <p>
      Proot is based in Toulouse (France) but the artists that feature on the
      label come from everywhere in the world.
